# While Death Draws Near

I had eyes but failed to see
What was precious to me
I had ears but failed to hear
The words of the ones who were dear

I had a tongue but failed to say
The thing that I needed to relay
I had a heart but failed to feel
Anything that could've been real

Empty and alone I am here
While death draws near
Thoughts of the life I could've lived
Crashes into what I had believed

Can I change before I die
Or will I tell yet another lie
Will Death set aside his duty
For me to enjoy life's new found beauty
